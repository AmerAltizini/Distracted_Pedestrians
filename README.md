### About Dataset
The Distracted Pedestrians Dataset, a Human Activity Recognition (HAR) dataset, includes an inertial sensor-embedded smartphone on 10 study subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL), distracting activities. The purpose is to classify the six performed activities.
### Description of experiment
Experiments were conducted with a group of 10 volunteers ranging in age from 19 to 31 years. Each subject performed six activities (WALK, WALK UP, WALK DOWN, SIT, STAND, LAY) while using a smartphone (MOTO G100). Using the built-in accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axis linear acceleration and her 3-axis angular velocity at her constant 50 Hz rate. The experiment was videotaped to manually label the data. The resulting dataset was randomly divided into two sets, with 70% of volunteers selected for training data generation and 30% for test data.

Sensor signals (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer) were preprocessed by applying a noise filter and sampled in sliding windows of fixed width of 2.56 s and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). A filter with a cutoff frequency of 0.3 Hz was used because gravity is considered to have only low-frequency components. A feature vector was obtained from each window by computing the time-domain and frequency-domain variables.

### Attribute information
For each record in the dataset, the following is provided:

1. Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer.
2. Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.
3. Triaxial magnetometer
4. Its activity label.
5. An identifier of the subject who experimented.
